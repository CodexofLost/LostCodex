## How It Works

1. **Setup**:  
   - Install the app on your Android device.
   - Create a Telegram bot with the help of Botfather and obtain the token.
   - Complete the in-app setup by placing bot token and device nickname in  Setup Screen.
   - Set the Telegram webhook (in-app button) and set nickanme to save & continue.
   - Then, Open your bot in Telegram and send /register (nickname)
   - Now, you are ready to send commands via Telegram.

2. **Remote Control**:  
   - Send commands to your Telegram bot (e.g., `/photo`, `/video`, `/location`).
   - The app receives the command via FCM, executes the action, and uploads the result (photo, audio, location, etc.) back to Telegram.

3. **Notifications & File Management**:  
   - Receive mirrored notifications from selected apps.
   - Browse, download, and upload files directly through Telegram.
